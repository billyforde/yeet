		<h2>The method in which the Solar Fish House will be contructed</h2>
		<p>To start off, the use of photovoltaic panels will be integrated into the home's roof design. To do this, the panels must be thin and bendable, to fit the wavy design of the roof. These solar panels will be fitted around the edge  of the roof.</p>
		
		<p>The green roof is going to be installed inside the ring of solar panels on the roof of the home. Keep in mind that the home will have multiple roofs, so the green roof is only going to be apart of one roof, with the other roof only being fitted with exclusively solar panels.</p>
		<p>The solar panels will be the only source of electricity coming inside the home, and making sure they function how they're supposed to is very important. To do this, wires connected to the solar panels will supply the energy taken from the panels to the house. This energy will be first to a converted using a converter to change the DC (Direct Current) energy to AC (Alternate Current). This will power the home efficiently and safely, unlike the usual homes around the world.</p>
		<p>The usual house installation procedures will be the same for the Solar Fish House, besides the way that the power is set up. The overall construction of the house will be fairly easy and quick.</p>
