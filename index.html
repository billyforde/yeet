But it is a new age, and affordable, bio-friendly houseing is on the market, and changeing lives rapidly, because we now have access to affordable homes, that are carefully constructed for the saftey of all families and their enviroment as well. Doing something as simple as buying a bio-friendly house, can make everyones lives more easy and happy.
    	The varius Benefits to owning a bio-friendly home include:
