		<h1>The Planning and Construction of a Bio-Friendly Home: The Solar Fish House</h1>
	</header>
	<article>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The Solar Fish House is a bio-friendly home that's created with the environment in mind. This house is constructed in a beach area, near a beautiful body of water. The design of the home takes these features to it's advantage. The Solar Fish House features a pool right outside of it, with all of the house construction consisting of wood, concrete, and glass. Now you may be asking yourself, "How is this house going to be bio friendly?" And the answer is  with the use of solar panels. Solar panels are fairly new in the eco friendly world, but they work very efficiently and will power the house with as much energy as it needs. The Solar Fish House will have these solar panels placed on the multiple roofs that it has, with one also featuring a green roof. This is just a simple overview of the house itself.</p>

		To know the construction and planning of the Solar Fish house, you have to know the importance of owning one. In the past, just to own a home, you had to spend a large amount of money for a random house that looks good on the surface, but could have some unkown flaws. On top of that, we all need a place to live, so most will just run in and buy a house to move in as soon as possible. But it is a new age, and affordable, bio-friendly houseing is on the market, and changing lives rapidly, because we now have access to affordable homes, that are carefully constructed for the safety of all families and their environment as well. Doing something as simple as buying a bio-friendly house, can make everyone's lives more easy and happy.
		<h2>The various benefits to owning a bio-friendly home</h2>
   	  <ul>
    		<li><u><b>Water and Energy Efficiency:</b></u> Along with lower utility bills and the ability to "Live off the grid", bio-friendly building practices heavily reduce the dependability on non-renewable resources, which are expensive and major contributers to enviromental pollution. Energy costs are reduced with a decrease in heating and cooling requirements. With the use of efficient plumbing to reduce waste, along with advanced irrigation systems, you can safely know you are using natural resources effectively.</li>	
			<li><u><b>Low Operating Costs:</b></u> Taking the advantage of enhanced daylight throughout our houses, solar heating and enviromentally-friendly lighting are just a few of the money-saving options. Use of long lasting, recycled materials ensure that you will spend less on maintenance over time. Sustainability is a key advantage to owning a home of the future! </li>
			<li><u><b>Reduced Enviromental Footprint:</b></u>Bio-Friendly homes are built to last, so when it comes to the hastle of replacing carpet or decking every few years, don't even worry about it, we got you covered. Building practices minimize waste, helping achieve efficient use.</li>
			<li><u><b>Healthier and Happier Living:</b></u> Paints, Cleaners, and Adhesives will contain substantially fewer harmful chemicals, because we incorporate products that use little to no toxic Volatile Organic Compounds. Indoor air-quality is of utmost care and consideration while building a home like the Solar fish house.</li>
