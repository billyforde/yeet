		<h2><u>How the Solar Fish House will be planned out</u></h2>
		<p>The planning of the Solar Fish House will start out with understanding how much space that the home will take up. The land will have to be plotted out, and then the next important step comes. This step is of course knowing the materials that are required to build the bio friendly home. Seeing as the home is being solely powered by solar panels, the home will need to be prepared for such things. Solar panels require a direct path to sunlight, meaning that they will be placed onto the roof of the home. Then, the power that they receive from the sunlight will be transferred through wires, and then carried throughout the home to supply it with electricity.</p>
		<p>For this house, we will also need to know our budget. The house will likely cost a fair sum of cash, but not nearly as much as a normal home you'd find in a casual suburban neighborhood. Knowing the budget of the home will enable us to set our sights on the different materials we will need to look into.</p>
		<p>The materials other than solar panels required to build this home will be similar to that of a normal home. The home features a large amount of glass, which makes up the majority of the build itself, with hints of wood and other materials scattered all around. As for the roof, it will feature a green roof, with solar panels spread around the outside of it. The other multiple roofs of the home will be completely made up of solar panels, to supply the home with the energy that it needs.</p>
		<p>Overall, the planning of the Solar Fish House will require knowing the budget, materials required, and how the solar panels themselves work. This is how the Solar Fish House will be planned.</p>
